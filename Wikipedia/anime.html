        However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from a
        shortening of the English word animation) describes all animated works,
        regardless of style or origin. Animation produced outside of Japan with
        similar style to Japanese animation is commonly referred to as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime-influenced_animation"
          >anime-influenced animation</a
        >.
      </p>

        The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917. A
        characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of
        cartoonist
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Tezuka">Osamu Tezuka </a>
        and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience.
        Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_video_animation"
          >directly to home media</a
        >, and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_net_animation"
          >over the Internet</a
        >. In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of
        Japanese comics (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga">manga</a
        >),
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_novels">light novels</a>,

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_games_in_Japan"

        niche audiences.

        Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have
        adapted in response to emergent technologies. It combines graphic art,
        characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and
        individualistic techniques.<sup

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime#cite_note-FOOTNOTECraig2000139%E2%80%93140-2"

          ></sup
        >
        Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less
        on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera
        effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots.<sup

        Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can
        be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and
        emotive eyes.<sup

      <h2>Etymology</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        As a type of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation">animation</a>, anime
        is an art form that comprises many
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre">genres</a> found in other
        mediums; it is sometimes mistakenly classified as a genre itself.<sup
          ><a

            >[5]</a
          ></sup
        >
        In Japanese, the term anime is used to refer to all animated works,
        regardless of style or origin.<sup
          ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime#cite_note-6"
            >[6]</a
          ></sup
        >
        English-language dictionaries typically define anime (<a

          >/ˈænɪmeɪ/</a

        as "a style of Japanese animation"<sup

        or as "a style of animation originating in Japan".<sup

            >[9]</a
          ></sup

        Other definitions are based on origin, making production in Japan a
        requisite for a work to be considered "anime".<sup

        The etymology of the term anime is disputed. The English word
        "animation" is written in Japanese
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana">katakana</a> as
        アニメーション (animēshon) and as アニメ (anime, pronounced
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Japanese">[a.ɲi.me]</a>
        ( &#128266;<a
          href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Ja-Anime.oga"

            >[10]</a
          ></sup
        >
        Some sources claim that the term is derived from the French term for
        animation dessin animé ("cartoon", literally 'animated design'),<sup
          ><a

            >[11]</a

        >
        but others believe this to be a myth derived from the popularity of
        anime in France in the late 1970s and 1980s.<sup

      <p>
        In English, anime—when used as a common
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun">noun</a>—normally functions
        as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_noun">mass noun</a>.
        (For example: "Do you watch anime?" or "How much anime have you
        collected?")<sup

        As with a few other Japanese words, such as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sak%C3%A9">saké</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon">Pokémon</a>,
        English texts sometimes spell anime as animé (as in French), with an
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent">acute accent</a>
        over the final e, to cue the reader to pronounce the letter, not to
        leave it silent as English orthography may suggest. Prior to the
        widespread use of anime, the term Japanimation was prevalent throughout
        the 1970s and 1980s. In the mid-1980s, the term anime began to supplant
        Japanimation;<sup

            >[14]</a
          ></sup
        >
        in general, the latter term now only appears in period works where it is
        used to distinguish and identify Japanese animation.<sup

Traveling storytellers narrated legends and anecdotes while the emakimono was unrolled from the right to left with chronological order, as a moving panorama.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime#cite_note-:1-16">[16]</a></sup>  Kagee was popular during the Edo period and originated from the shadows play of China.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime#cite_note-:1-16">[16]</a></sup>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_lantern">Magic lanterns</a> from the Netherlands were also popular in the eighteenth century.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime#cite_note-:1-16">[16]</a></sup>  The paper play called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamishibai">Kamishibai</a> surged in the twelfth century and remained popular in the street theater until the 1930s.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime#cite_note-:1-16">[16]</a></sup>  Puppets of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunraku">bunraku</a> theater and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukiyo-e">ukiyo-e</a> prints are considered ancestors of characters of most Japanese animations.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime#cite_note-:1-16">[16]</a></sup>  Finally, mangas were a heavy inspiration for anime.

            Animation in Japan began in the early 20th century, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director">filmmakers</a> started to experiment with techniques pioneered in France, Germany, the United States, and Russia.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchodt1997-11">[11]</a></sup> A claim for the earliest Japanese animation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsud%C5%8D_Shashin">Katsudō Shashin</a> (c. 1907),<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>  a private work by an unknown creator.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>  In 1917, the first professional and publicly displayed works began to appear; animators such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Cten_Shimokawa">Ōten Shimokawa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seitar%C5%8D_Kitayama">Seitarō Kitayama</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jun%27ichi_K%C5%8Duchi">Jun'ichi Kōuchi</a> (considered the "fathers of anime") produced numerous films, the oldest surviving of which is Kōuchi's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namakura_Gatana">Namakura Gatana</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime#cite_note-17">[19]</a></sup>  Many early works were lost with the destruction of Shimokawa's warehouse in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1923_Great_Kant%C5%8D_earthquake">1923 Great Kantō earthquake</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime#cite_note-17">[20]</a></sup>

            Anime differs from other forms of animation by its art styles, methods of animation, its production, and its process. Visually, anime works exhibit a wide variety of art styles, differing between creators, artists, and studios. While no single art style predominates anime as a whole, they do share some similar attributes in terms of animation technique and character design.

            Anime artists employ many distinct visual styles.
            <br><br>
            Anime is fundamentally characterized by the use of limited animation, flat expression, the suspension of time, its thematic range, the presence of historical figures, its complex narrative line and, above all, a peculiar drawing style, with characters characterized by large and oval eyes, with very defined lines, bright colors and reduced movement of the lips.

        <h3>characters</h3>
        <p>
            The body proportions of human anime characters tend to accurately reflect the proportions of the human body in reality. The height of the head is considered by the artist as the base unit of proportion. Head heights can vary, but most anime characters are about seven to eight heads tall. Anime artists occasionally make deliberate modifications to body proportions to produce super deformed characters that feature a disproportionately small body compared to the head; many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_deformed">super deformed </a>characters are two to four heads tall. Some anime works like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayon_Shin-chan">Crayon Shin-chan</a> completely disregard these proportions, in such a way that they resemble <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caricature">caricatured</a> Western <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon">cartoons</a>.
